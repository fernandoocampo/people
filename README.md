This is a microservice project built on Rust. The idea is to learn about building this type of applications with the language.

## Technologies

### Tokio
[Tokio](https://tokio.rs) is an asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language. It provides the building blocks needed for writing network applications.

### Warp
[warp](https://docs.rs/warp/latest/warp/) is a super-easy, composable, web server framework for warp speeds.

## How to test it?

I added a Makefile, but feel free to run them as they are.

```sh
make test
```

or

```sh
cargo test
```

## How to run it?

```sh
make run
```

or

```sh
cargo run
```

you will see something like this

```sh
‚è±Ô∏è	Starting people api application...
üóø	Starting database connection...
üõ§Ô∏è  Establishing API routes...
üë§	Creating people endpoint: GET /people
üë§	Creating get person endpoint: GET /people/{id}
üë§	Creating update person endpoint: PUT /people/{id}
üë§	Creating add person endpoint: POST /people
üçè	Server has started at :3030
```

once you finished just hit `ctrl + c`

## How to call the API?

* Create a person endpoint

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"id":"3", "name":"Esme"}' \
-X POST http://localhost:3030/people

Person added
```

* Calling get people endpoint

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:3030/people
[{"id":"1","name":"Luis"},{"id":"2","name":"Fernando"}]
```

* Calling get a person endpoint

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:3030/people/1
{"id":"1","name":"Luis"}
```

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:3030/people/200
Person not found
```

* Update a person endpoint

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"id":"1", "name":"LuisFer"}' \
-X PUT http://localhost:3030/people/1

Person updated
```

* Delete a person endpoint

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X DELETE http://localhost:3030/people/2

Person deleted
```
